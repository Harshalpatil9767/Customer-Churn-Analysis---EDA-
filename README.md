# Customer-Churn-Analysis---EDA-
📊 Teco Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python
This project explores customer churn behavior for a telecommunications company (Teco) using exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python. The goal is to identify key drivers of churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

🔍 Objective

• Analyze customer data to uncover patterns and factors contributing to churn, particularly focusing on:
• Contract types
• Payment methods
• Customer tenure
• Demographic and service-related variables

📈 Key Insights

• Contract Types: Month-to-month contracts have a churn rate of 42%, while yearly and two-year contracts see significantly lower rates (11% and 3%, respectively).
• Payment Methods: Electronic check users churn at a rate of 45%, compared to 15–18% for other payment types.
• Tenure Impact: Customers in their first year churn the most (50%), while those with over 3 years of tenure drop to just 15%.
• Senior Citizens: Seniors (65+) show a churn rate of 41%, versus 26% for younger customers.
• Internet Type: Fiber optic users churn more (30%) than DSL users (20%).

📊 Visualizations

• Bar plots and line graphs illustrating churn by payment method, tenure, contract type, and demographics.
• Percentage-based comparisons for more intuitive interpretation.

✅ Recommendations

• Promote long-term contracts with incentives.
• Encourage switching from electronic checks to more stable payment methods.
• Invest in early engagement strategies to retain new customers.
• Design targeted retention offers for senior citizens.

🛠️ Tools Used

• Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# Customer-Churn-Analysis
üîç Objective

‚Ä¢ This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer churn data from a telecommunications company, Teco. The goal is to understand which factors most influence customer churn, such as contract types, payment methods, internet service type, and customer tenure. These insights help recommend actions to improve customer retention.

üìà Key Insights

‚Ä¢ Contract Type and Churn
Customers with month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate at 42%. In contrast, customers with one-year and two-year contracts have churn rates of 11% and 3%, respectively. This suggests that long-term contracts help reduce churn.

‚Ä¢ Payment Methods
Customers paying via electronic check have the highest churn rate of 45%, while those using credit cards, bank transfers, or mailed checks churn much less, around 15%‚Äì18%. Electronic payments may lack trust or convenience for some users.

‚Ä¢ Customer Tenure
Churn is highest (50%) among customers in their first year. It drops to 35% for customers in their second and third years, and to just 15% for those who have stayed longer than three years. This shows how important early customer experience is.

‚Ä¢ Internet Service Type
Customers using Fiber Optic internet churn more (30%) than DSL users (20%). This may be due to technical issues, competition, or service expectations related to fiber plans.

‚Ä¢ Senior Citizens and Churn
Senior citizens (65+) have a churn rate of 41%, which is significantly higher than the 26% churn rate for younger customers. This group may benefit from more personalized communication or support.

üìä Visualizations
‚Ä¢ Bar Charts: Used to compare churn rates across different categories like payment methods, contract types, and internet services. One key chart shows that electronic check users churn nearly 3x more than credit card users.

‚Ä¢ Line Graphs: Show the trend of churn by customer tenure. The graphs clearly highlight that churn reduces the longer a customer stays with the company.

‚Ä¢ Distribution Plots: Used to explore how churn varies across demographic groups like senior citizens and gender, helping identify which groups need special attention.

‚Ä¢ Percentage Labels: Many visualizations include percentages to make it easier to interpret churn differences across groups.
